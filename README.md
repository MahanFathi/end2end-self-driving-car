# End-to-end Self-driving Car (Behavioral Cloning)

### This repo contains:
* Implements [NVIDIA's DAVE-2]() neural network in pure PyTorch (PilotNet)
* Data augmentation in train-feed pipeline
* [VisualBackProp]() if it's of any help to sanity-checking the network
* Downloads all the data you need for your first run 
* Easy-tweaking configurations
* Ready-to-use inference API

### Usage 
Simply run `python3 main.py` to train a PilotNet from scratch. This should only take a few hours on a descent GPU.
